# Factory Pattern

Key here is to identify what varies and encapsulate it. 

To do this we move the object creation logic out of the class. We move it into a FACTORY class.

Just doing this alone is known as the simple factory.

## Intent

Define an interface gor creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
